## Learning Objectives

- Understand the core concepts of Physical AI.
- Differentiate between traditional AI and Physical AI.
- Explore the challenges and opportunities in embodied intelligence.

## Core Concepts

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that interact with the physical world through sensors and actuators. Unlike traditional AI, which primarily operates in digital environments, Physical AI is embodied, meaning it exists within a physical body (like a robot) and experiences the world directly. This embodiment introduces unique challenges such as real-time interaction, sensor noise, motor control, and safety considerations.

Key concepts include:
- **Embodied Intelligence**: AI systems that possess a physical body and interact with the real world.
- **Sensors**: Devices that gather information from the physical environment (e.g., cameras, lidar, force sensors).
- **Actuators**: Devices that enable physical interaction with the environment (e.g., motors, grippers).
- **Perception-Action Loop**: The continuous cycle of sensing the environment, processing information, making decisions, and performing actions.

## Summary

Physical AI is an emerging field that focuses on developing intelligent systems capable of interacting with the real world. It combines principles from AI, robotics, and control theory to create embodied agents that can perceive, reason, and act in physical environments. The unique challenges of Physical AI, such as real-time processing and safety, differentiate it from purely software-based AI.

## Assessment / Mini Project

1.  **Discussion Question**: What are the main differences between a chatbot (traditional AI) and a humanoid robot (Physical AI) in terms of their interaction with the world and the challenges they face?
2.  **Research Task**: Identify and describe three real-world applications of Physical AI.
